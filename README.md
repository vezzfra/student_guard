# Student Guard
An iOS and Android project to protect University students from thieves. 

In 2018 the main problem everyone was talking about in the Milan's University was THIEVES. 
In collaboration with a student association I developed an app that permitted all the users to notify everyone else about recent thefts and about suspicious people.

The concept of the app was quite simple: 

   - The user after registering to the service could decide from which campus he wanted to receive push notifications;
   - On the app opening the system gets the live location of the user and then show the nearest reports;
